## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Starlight website set up.
If you don't have one yet, you can follow the ["Getting Started"](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) guide in the Starlight docs to create one.

## Installation

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

<Steps>

1. Install the Starlight Package Managers component using your favorite package manager:

   <PackageManagers pkg="starlight-save-file-component" />

2. Use the component in any MDX files of your Starlight documentation site.

   ```mdx title="src/content/docs/example.mdx"
   import { SaveFile } from "starlight-save-file-component";

   <SaveFile title="Example PDF" href="../../../public/example.pdf" />
   ```

3. [Start the development server](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/#start-the-development-server) to preview the component.
